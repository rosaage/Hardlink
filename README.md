# Hardlink
This is a small windows program utilizing the windows API to make a hardlink (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_link) of multiple files and place them all in one folder. This is useful if you have say a folder with 5 subfolders each containing several files, and without changing the structure you want all the files in the same folder. The files may look like duplicates but in fact you will see no additional storage space has been used.
